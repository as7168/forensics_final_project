# forensics_final_project
pcap visualizer

The purpose of this project is to create an open source tool to visualize a pcap file.
The tool will be able to input a pcap file and output a visual representation of the network depicted in the pcap file.
Furthermore, it will also show the type of protocols/services being used by the nodes/hosts in the network.
