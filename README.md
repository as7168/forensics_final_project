# Forensics Final Project - Pcap Visualizer

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to create an open source tool to visualize a pcap file.
The tool is able to input a pcap file and output a visual representation of the network depicted in the pcap file.
Furthermore, it also shows the type of protocols/services being used by the nodes/hosts in the network.

## Usage

usage: pcap_parser_project.py [-h] [-i IP_ADDR] [-b START] [-f END] [-r] pcap outfile

### Mandatory Arguments

#### 1. Pcap file
          Input pcap file to be processed by the tool. This file must be in the same directory as the tool (pcap_parser_project.py)
#### 2. Output image file name
          Name of the image file you want the graph (generated by the tool) to be stored as
### Optional Arguments

#### 1. IP Address (-i <ip address> --ip_addr=<ip address>)
          If you want to focus the analysis on a specific IP address, you can give that ip address and the tool will only display the connections related to that ip address
#### 2. Starting Connection Edge (-b <edge number> --start=<edge number>)
